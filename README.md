##OBS Studio Control
Arduino-based OBS studio control system.

This project is modeled after the Elgato Stream Deck but entirely open source.

This project is free for people to clone and use but I'd really appreciate commits back to make it better.

Version History:
v1.0 -- Basic functionality includes scene change management, webcam control, microphone control, audio control, stream control, recording control
